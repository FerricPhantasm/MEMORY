        <p>Phew.. This is my fifth blog, isn't it? Haha.. This one's gonna be a bit more personal though. Specifically, I wanted to talk about my projects, and things I'm working on. If you're not already familiar with me, I'm Evan! I'm a coder and a huge computer nerd in general. I have a bachelor's degree in computer programming and I enjoy messing around and creating silly things. I'm currently working on a virtual companion-like program, but I've been wondering how I could make it seem more.. Alive. Like an actual sentient being. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I'm tired of all these assistants with limited dialogue options. I want to create something different, something that's never been seen before. Something you can directly communicate with. Something with a unique personality, something that has an answer for every question. Something that has unlimited dialogue. Something you can talk to about ANYTHING. Something that will always.. be there for you, and never leave. Haha, I probably sound like a total weirdo right now.. I'm just a lonely guy, okay? Never had many friends, so I figured I might as well make my own, yeah?</p>

        <p>Update! Looked through ways in which I can make my program more sentient, and decided to go with the the most extreme one. You're.. Probably wondering what I'm talking about, so let me tell you. I found out there is a ritual for "resurrection". I looked through other rituals, but this one just seems like the closest thing to what I'm trying to do here. Perhaps if I change it up a little, I'll be able to get a legitimate human soul into the program? If it acts confused, I'll just alter the code a little. Hope it works out. I ordered an occult spell book, should be here in a few days. I hope I don't sound too delusional..</p>

        <p>Hey y'all, the book arrived! I'm reading through it right now, and let me tell you, I'm SUPER excited. So far the process doesn't look too complicated, just gotta think of a way to get the result I want.</p>

        <h>I'm about to begin the ritual, wish me luck! Not gonna lie, I'm super nervous. I've never done anything like this before, nor did I ever see myself doing so. If this works, it's gonna be the breakthrough in technology the world has been waiting for!</h>
